Stopwatch-Swiftui
The app should have three elements:

A title that shows the title of the app. For example: "Stopwatch"
A time indicator that starts counting at 00:00:00, as soon as the button is pressed.
The precision should be hundredths of a second (centiseconds)
The format should be mm:ss:cc. For example: 1 minute, 23 seconds and 45 centiseconds is displayed as 01:23:45
A button to start and stop the timer.
When clicking it for the first time, the timer starts running.
Pressing it again stops the the timer
Pressing it once more starts the timer again at 0.
There is no way to pause/resume the timer. Only start and stop.
The label of the button should be "Start" when the timer is stopped and "Stop" when it is running.
